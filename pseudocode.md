# Hangman (Pseudocode)

```
- Create 2 variables, one named player_1 (which will represent the player who will input the word) and player_2 (which will represent the player that will attempting to guess the word).

- Another variable 

- The variable player_1 will allow the user to input a string, the variable player_2 will allow for the the player to input a single word.

- Another variable (perferably named word_length) will determine the number of letters in the string player_1 inputed.

- A number of blanks will be printed out according to the number of letters gathered in word_length (this too will be assigned to a variable)

- The character variable player_2 will be considered, if it matches any character in the word player_1 inputed (which can be done via a loop and an if statement)
