# Hangman Code

```
def get_guess():
  Validity = False
  while Validity == False:
    Letter = input('Enter a Letter')
    Letter_Length = int(len(Letter))
    for x in "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm":
      if Letter == x and Letter_Length > 0 and Letter_Length < 2:
        Validity = True
      
      if Validity == True:
        return Letter
      
 This is my code, check it out on repl.it, it works.  If you'd like me to submit it, tell me on instagram (type in Patrick, you'll see 'starfish_is_bored').  
 If you have your own code, please post it below mine and we'll discuss it in a group chat. (This INCLUDES THE 'def get_guess():')
