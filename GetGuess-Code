# Hangman Code

```
Validity = False

while Validity == False:
  Letter = input('Enter a Letter')
  Letter_Length = int(len(Letter))
  for x in "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm":
    if Letter == x and Letter_Length > 0 and Letter_Length < 2:
      Validity = True
      
 This is my code, check it out on repl.it, it works.  If you'd like me to submit it, tell me on instagram (type in Patrick, I'm 'starfish_is_bored').  
 If you have your own code, post it below mines and we'll discuss it in a group chat.
