# Hangman Code

```
  validity = False
  while validity == False:
    letter = input('Enter a letter')
    for x in "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm":
      if letter == x and len(letter) > 0 and len(letter) < 2:
        validity = True
      
      if validity == True:
        return letter
      
 This is my code, check it out on repl.it, it works.  If you'd like me to submit it, tell me on instagram (type in Patrick, you'll see 'starfish_is_bored').  
 If you have your own code, please post it below mine and we'll discuss it in a group chat. (This INCLUDES THE 'def get_guess():')
